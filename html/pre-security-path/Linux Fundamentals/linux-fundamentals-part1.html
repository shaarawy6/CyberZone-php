                            <p>It's fair to say that Linux is a lot more intimidating to approach than Operating System's (OSs) such as Windows. Both variants have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Linux is considerably much more lightweight and you'd be surprised to know that there's a good chance you've used Linux in some form or another every day! Linux powers things such as:</p><br>
                            <ul style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">
                            <li>Websites that you visit</li>
                            <li>Car entertainment/control panels</li>
                            <li>Point of Sale (PoS) systems such as checkout tills and registers in shops</li>
                            <li>Critical infrastructures such as traffic light controllers or industrial sensors</li>
                            </ul><br>
                            <h2>Flavours of Linux</h2><br>
                            <p>The name "Linux" is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX (another operating system). Thanks to UNIX being open-source, variants of Linux comes in all shapes and sizes - suited best for what the system is being used for.</p><br>
                            <p>For example, Ubuntu & Debian are some of the more commonplace distributions of Linux because it is so extensible. I.e. you can run Ubuntu as a server (such as websites & web applications) or as a fully-fledged desktop. For this series, we're going to be using Ubuntu.</p><br>
                            <p>Ubuntu Server can run on systems with only 512MB of RAM</p><br>
                            <p>Similar to how you have different versions Windows (7, 8 and 10), there are many different versions/distributions of Linux.</p>

                            <p>As we previously discussed, a large selling point of using OSs such as Ubuntu is how lightweight they can be. This, of course, doesn't come without its disadvantages, where for example, often there is no GUI (Graphical User Interface) or what is also known as a desktop environment that we can use to interact with the machine (unless it has been installed). A large part of interacting with these systems is using the "Terminal".</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>The "Terminal" is purely text-based and is intimidating at first. However, if we break down some of the commands, after some time, you quickly become familiar with using the terminal!</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>This is what a terminal looks like<br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$ enter commands here</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>We need to be able to do basic functions like navigate to files, output their contents and make files! The commands to do so are self-explanatory (once you know what they are of course...)</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>Let's get started with two of the first commands which I have broken down in the table below:</p>

                            <table style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">

                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>echo</td>
                                <td>Output any text that we provide</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>whoami</td>
                                <td>Find out what user we're currently logged in as!</td>
                            </tr>

                            <p><strong>Listing Files in Our Current Directory (ls)</strong><br>
                            Before we can do anything such as finding out the contents of any files or folders, we need to know what exists in the first place. This can be done using the "ls" command (short for listing)</p>

                            <p><strong>Changing Our Current Directory (cd)</strong><br>
                            Now that we know what folders exist, we need to use the "cd" command (short for change directory) to change to that directory. Say if I wanted to open the "Pictures" directory - I'd do "cd Pictures". Where again, we want to find out the contents of this "Pictures" directory and to do so, we'd use "ls" again:</p>

                            Whilst knowing about the existence of files is great — it's not all that useful unless we're able to view the contents of them.</p>

                            <li>Used "ls" to let us know what files are available in the "Documents" folder of this machine. In this case, it is called "todo.txt".</li>
                            <li>We have then used cat todo.txt to concatenate/output the contents of this "todo.txt" file, where the contents are "Here's something important for me to do later!"</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>Finding out the full Path to our Current Working Directory (pwd)</strong><br>
                            You'll notice as you progress through navigating your Linux machine, the name of the directory that you are currently working in will be listed in your terminal.</p>

                            <li>We already know we're in "Documents" thanks to our terminal, but at this point in time, we have no idea where "Documents" is stored so that we can get back to it easily in the future.</li>
                            <li>I have used the "pwd" (print working directory) command to find the full file path of this "Documents" folder.</li>
                            <li>We're helpfully told by Linux that this "Documents" directory is stored at "/home/ubuntu/Documents" on the machine — great to know!</li>

                            <p>Although it doesn't seem like it so far, one of the redeeming features of Linux is truly how efficient you can be with it. With that said, you can only be as efficient as you are familiar with it of course. As you interact with OSs such as Ubuntu over time, essential commands like those we've already covered will start to become muscle-memory.</p>

                            <h2>Using Find</h2><br>

                            <p>The find command is fantastic in the sense that it can be used both very simply or rather complex depending upon what it is you want to do exactly. However, let's stick to the fundamentals first.</p><br>

                            <p>Take the snippet below; we can see a list of directories available to us:</p><br>

                            <p>Using "ls" to list the contents of the current directory</p><br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$ ls<br>
                            Desktop Documents Pictures folder1<br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$<br>

                            <ul style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">
                            <li>Desktop</li>
                            <li>Documents</li>
                            <li>Pictures</li>
                            <li>folder1</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Now, of course, directories can contain even more directories within themselves. It becomes a headache when we're having to look through every single one just to try and look for specific files. We can use find to do just this for us!</p><br>

                            <p>Let's start simple and assume that we already know the name of the file we're looking for — but can't remember where it is exactly! In this case, we're looking for "passwords.txt"</p><br>

                            <p>If we remember the filename, we can simply use find -name passwords.txt where the command will look through every folder in our current directory for that specific file like so:</p><br>

                            <p>Using "find" to find a file with the name of "passwords.txt"</p><br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$ find -name passwords.txt<br>
                            ./folder1/passwords.txt<br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$<br>

                            <p>"Find" has managed to find the file — it turns out it is located in folder1/passwords.txt — sweet. But let's say that we don't know the name of the file, or want to search for every file that has an extension such as ".txt". Find let's us do that too!</p><br>

                            <p>We can simply use what's known as a wildcard (*) to search for anything that has .txt at the end. In our case, we want to find every .txt file that's in our current directory. We will construct a command such as find -name *.txt . Where "Find" has been able to find every .txt file and has then given us the location of each one:</p><br>

                            <p>Using "find" to find any file with the extension of ".txt"</p><br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$ find -name *.txt<br>
                            ./folder1/passwords.txt<br>
                            ./Documents/todo.txt<br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$<br>

                            <p>Find has managed to find:</p><br>

                            <ul style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">
                            <li>"passwords.txt" located within "folder1"</li>
                            <li>"todo.txt" located within "Documents"</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>That wasn't so tough, huh!</p><br>

                            <h2>Using Grep</h2><br>

                            <p>Another great utility that is a great one to learn about is the use of grep. The grep command allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for.</p><br>

                            <p>Take for example, the access log of a web server. In this case, the access.log of a web server has 244 entries.</p><br>

                            <p>Using "wc" to count the number of entries in "access.log"</p><br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$ wc -l access.log<br>
                            244 access.log<br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$<br>

                            <p>Using a command like cat isn't going to cut it too well here. Let's say for example if we wanted to search this log file to see the things that a certain user/IP address visited? Looking through 244 entries isn't all that efficient considering we want to find a specific value.</p><br>

                            <p>We can use grep to search the entire contents of this file for any entries of the value that we are searching for. Going with the example of a web server's access log, we want to see everything that the IP address "81.143.211.90" has visited (note that this is fictional)</p><br>

                            <p>Using "grep" to find any entries with the IP address of "81.143.211.90" in "access.log"</p><br>
                            tryhackme@linux1:~$ grep "81.143.211.90" access.log<br>
                            81.143.211.90 - - [25/Mar/2021:11:17 + 0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 417 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; Moto G(4))"<br>

                            <tr>
                                <td>>></td>
                                <td>This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).</td>
                            </tr>
                            </table><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Let's cover these in a bit more detail.</p><br>

                            <h2 style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Operator "&"</h2><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">This operator allows us to execute commands in the background. For example, let's say we want to copy a large file. This will obviously take quite a long time and will leave us unable to do anything else until the file successfully copies.</p><br>

                            <h2 style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Operator "&&"</h2><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">This shell operator is a bit misleading in the sense of how familiar is to its partner "&". Unlike the "&" operator, we can use "&&" to make a list of commands to run for example command1 && command2. However, it's worth noting that command2 will only run if command1 was successful.</p><br>

                            <h2 style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Operator ">"</h2><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">This operator is what's known as an output redirector. What this essentially means is that we take the output from a command we run and send that output to somewhere else.</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">A great example of this is redirecting the output of the echo command that we learned in Task 4. Of course, running something such as echo howdy will return "howdy" back to our terminal — that isn't super useful. What we can do instead, is redirect "howdy" to something such as a new file!</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Let's say we wanted to create a file named "welcome" with the message "hey". We can run echo hey > welcome where we want the file created with the contents "hey" like so:</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Using the > Operator</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">tryhackme@linux1:~$ echo hey > welcome</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Using cat to output the "welcome" file</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">tryhackme@linux1:~$ cat welcome</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">hey</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Note: If the file i.e. "welcome" already exists, the contents will be overwritten!</p><br>

                            <h2 style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Operator ">>"</h2><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">This operator is also an output redirector like in the previous operator (>) we discussed. However, what makes this operator different is that rather than overwriting any contents within a file, for example, it instead just puts the output at the end.</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Following on with our previous example where we have the file "welcome" that has the contents of "hey". If were to use echo to add "hello" to the file using the > operator, the file will now only have "hello" and not "hey".</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">The >> operator allows to append the output to the bottom of the file — rather than replacing the contents like so:</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Using the >> Operator</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">tryhackme@linux1:~$ echo hello >> welcome</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">Using cat to output the "welcome" file</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">tryhackme@linux1:~$ cat welcome</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">hey</p><br>

                            <p style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">hello</p><br>
