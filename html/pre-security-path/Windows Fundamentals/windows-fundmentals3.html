                            <h2>Let's start things off with Windows Update.</h2><br>

                            <p>Windows Update is a service provided by Microsoft to provide security updates, feature enhancements, and patches for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Defender.</p><br>

                            <p>Updates are typically released on the 2nd Tuesday of each month. This day is called Patch Tuesday. That doesn't necessarily mean that a critical update/patch has to wait for the next Patch Tuesday to be released. If the update is urgent, then Microsoft will push the update via the Windows Update service to the Windows devices.</p><br>

                            <p>Refer to the following link to see the Microsoft Security Update Guide <a href="#">here</a>.</p><br>

                            <p>Windows Update is located in Settings. See below.</p><br>

                            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Another way to access Windows Update is from the Run dialog box, or CMD, by running the command <code>control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate</code>.</p><br>

                            <p>In the attached VM, there are a few things to highlight.</p><br>

                            <ul style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">
                            <li>The Windows Update settings are 'managed'. (Typically, home users will not see this type of message)</li>
                            <li>There are no available updates available for the virtual machine. (The attached virtual machine does not have Internet access to communicate with Microsoft to obtain new updates)</li>
                            </ul><br>

                            <p>Throughout the years, Windows users have grown accustomed to pushing Windows Updates off to a later date or not installing the updates at all. Various reasons caused this action, one being the fact that a reboot is typically required after a Windows update.</p><br>

                            <p>Microsoft notably addressed this issue with Windows 10. The updates can no longer be ignored or pushed to the side until forgotten. Windows updates can only be postponed, but eventually, the update will happen, and your computer will reboot. Microsoft provides these updates to keep the device safe and secure.</p><br>

                            <p>Below is an image showing how a Restart required looks and the several options available regarding scheduling the restart.</p><br>

                            <p>Refer to the Windows Updates FAQ for more information.</p><br>

Since the VM can't reach the Internet and there aren't any threats in the VM, this is safe to do. Real-time protection should definitely be enabled in your personal Windows devices unless you have a 3rd party product that provides the same protection.

                            <p><strong>What is a firewall?</strong></p>

                            <p>Per Microsoft, "Traffic flows into and out of devices via what we call ports. A firewall is what controls what is - and more importantly isn't - allowed to pass through those ports. You can think of it like a security guard standing at the door, checking the ID of everything that tries to enter or exit".</p><br>

                            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Each network may have different status icons for you.</p><br>

                            <p><strong>What is the difference between the 3 (Domain, Private, and Public)?</strong></p>

                            <p>Per Microsoft, "Windows Firewall offers three firewall profiles: domain, private and public".</p><br>

                            <ul style="padding: 20px 0 0 55px;">
                            <li><strong>Domain:</strong> The domain profile applies to networks where the host system can authenticate to a domain controller.</li>
                            <li><strong>Private:</strong> The private profile is a user-assigned profile and is used to designate private or home networks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Public:</strong> The default profile is the public profile, used to designate public networks such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops, airports, and other locations.</li>
                            </ul><br>

                            <p>If you click on any firewall profile, another screen will appear with two options: turn the firewall on/off and block all incoming connections.</p><br>

                            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Unless you are 100% confident in what you are doing, it is recommended that you leave your Windows Defender Firewall enabled.</p><br>

                            <p><strong>Allow an app through firewall</strong></p><br>

                            <p>You can view what the current settings for any firewall profile are. In the above image, several apps have access in the Private and/or Public firewall profile. Some of the apps will provide additional information if it's available via the Details button.</p><br>

                            <p><strong>Advanced Settings</strong></p><br>

                            <p>Configuring the Windows Defender Firewall is for advanced Windows users. Refer to the following Microsoft documentation on best practices <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security-best-practices-and-requirements">here</a>.</p><br>

                            <p>Per Microsoft, "BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers".</p><br>

                            <p>On devices with TPM installed, BitLocker offers the best protection.</p><br>

                            <p>Per Microsoft, "BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline".</p><br>
